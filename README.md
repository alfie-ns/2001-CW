# 2001-CW

To use my Django admin account

sign in with {
username: `oladeanio`
password: `root`
}

Then, navigate to the trail-management template i.e. `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/trails/manage/`

In this page, the user i.e. me can add, edit or delete trails in the database

API documentation is generated by swagger; access it with `http://127.0.0.1:8000/swagger`
