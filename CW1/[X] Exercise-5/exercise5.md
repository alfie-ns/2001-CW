# Set-exercise 5: View:  10 marks

Identify and implement an appropriate view which couldbe used to substantially form the trails webpage,  combining  the  data  from  at  least  two  tables.  The SQL  code  and  screenshots  to demonstrate successful implementation should be included in your main report. You must implement the view under the schema “CW1”.  Remember that views can be queryable.  Ensure you have sufficient demo data within the tables so that the view returns data.  Failure to do so will result in a lower mark.
