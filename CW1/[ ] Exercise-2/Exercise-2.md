# Exercise 2

**Set-exercise 2**:  **Final Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) : 15 marks**

Create a final Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) for your micro-service.  This final ERD will be the result of combining the initial (or subsequent)ERD/s with the partial ERD resulting from your Normalisation.

This final ERD should only include entities and relationships (including relationship link phrases) that can be justified from reasonable assumptions.  **Make sure that all one-to-one and many-to-many relationships are resolved prior to submission.**  State any assumptions you have made.

Ensure that the ERD offers an accurate representation of the database. Inconsistencies between the ERD and the actual database implemented will mean marks are not earnt.
