# [X] Set Exercise 4: SQL: 15 marks

Following your analysis, create the appropriate SQL to form at least 3tables(including a ‘link entity’), include any keys/constraints, and implement these on your hosted Microsoft SQL Server database at  dist-6-505.uopnet.plymouth.ac.uk. Add sufficient data to  each  table  to  enable  testing  to  take place. Screenshots should be included in your main report to demonstrate (using SELECT statements)that sufficientdata is presentin all tables. You must use the schema “CW1” for your implementation to differentiate your coursework tables from any others.  Ensure you have demo data within the tables.  Failure to do so will result in a lower mark
